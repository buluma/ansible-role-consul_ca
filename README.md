## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-consul_ca/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: "Include buluma.consul_ca"
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: "buluma.consul_ca"
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-consul_ca/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.ca_certificates
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
    - role: buluma.go
      go_version: "1.17.3"

  tasks:
    - name: verify that Go is installed and available in the $PATH.
      command: go version
      environment:
        PATH: /usr/local/go/bin:{{ ansible_env.PATH }}
      changed_when: false
```

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-consul_ca/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
---
# defaults file for consul_ca
# Where to store the CA and certificate files. By default this
# will expand to user's LOCAL $HOME (the user that run's "ansible-playbook ..."
# plus "/consul/ssl". That means if the user's $HOME directory is e.g.
# "/home/da_user" then "consul_ca_conf_directory" will have a value of
# "/home/da_user/consul/ssl".
consul_ca_conf_directory: "{{ '~/consul/ssl' | expanduser }}"
# The user who own's the certificate directory and files
consul_ca_certificate_owner: "root"
# The group which own's the certificate directory and files
consul_ca_certificate_group: "root"
